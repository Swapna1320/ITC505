            <h2>Addendum</h2>
            <p>This is my addendum where I explain the reasoning for the HTML structure.</p>
            <p>I used the &lt;h1&gt; tag for the title because it represents the main heading of the document.</p>
            <p>The &lt;h2&gt; tags were used for the major sections to maintain a proper hierarchical structure.</p>
            <p>Bullet points were used in the Literature Review and Technological Advancements sections to enhance readability.</p>
            <h3>HTML Abuse</h3>
            <p>In the previous version, I had used a &lt;h2&gt; tag for the title for styling purposes, which I corrected by using a &lt;h1&gt; tag instead.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I replaced bolded text with appropriate headings and structured lists where needed.</p>
