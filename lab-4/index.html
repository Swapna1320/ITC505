    <h2>Addendum</h2>
    <p>This is my addendum where I explain the reasoning for the HTML structure.</p>
    <p>I used the &lt;h1&gt; tag for the title because it represents the main heading of the document, making it prominent and accessible for both readers and search engines.</p>
    <p>The &lt;h2&gt; tags were used for the major sections to maintain a proper hierarchical structure, ensuring that the content is logically organized and easy to navigate.</p>
    <p>Bullet points were used in the Literature Review and Technological Advancements sections to enhance readability and allow for concise, quick understanding of key points.</p>
    
    <h3>HTML Abuse</h3>
    <p>In the previous version, I had used a &lt;h2&gt; tag for the title for styling purposes, which I corrected by using a &lt;h1&gt; tag instead. This is to maintain proper semantic structure and improve accessibility for screen readers.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I replaced bolded text with appropriate headings and structured lists where needed to improve content clarity and visual hierarchy.</p>
    
    <h3>Stylistic Choices</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Typography:</strong> I opted for the <code>Arial</code> font family for its clean, modern, and sans-serif style, making it more legible on screens.</li>
        <li><strong>Color Palette:</strong> The color scheme uses soft and vibrant colors like <code>#2a9d8f</code> for headings, which are not only visually appealing but also provide a good contrast with the background for better readability.</li>
        <li><strong>Spacing:</strong> I used generous padding and margins around sections, making the content more breathable and improving the user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Responsiveness:</strong> The layout adjusts based on screen size, ensuring the content is well-organized and readable on mobile devices, enhancing the page's usability across various platforms.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> I aimed for consistency by using similar styles across the page for elements like <code>header</code>, <code>footer</code>, and <code>main</code>, ensuring a cohesive design.</li>
    </ul>
