        <p>
          While building this Space Adventure Mad Libs project, I came across a few technical challenges that helped me understand web development more deeply:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Form Submission Not Reaching Server:</strong> Initially, my form submissions weren’t reaching the Express server. After inspecting the routes and folder structure, I realized the issue was due to a mismatch between the form's `action` path and the server's route. I fixed this by correcting the form path to match the deployed environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Deploying on Render:</strong> Getting the app deployed correctly on Render was a bit tricky. My folder structure needed adjustment, especially placing files inside the correct subdirectory. I learned to structure repositories properly and define the right root folder for deployment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Static Files Not Loading:</strong> At one point, my CSS wasn’t loading. I learned this was because the `express.static()` middleware didn’t match the path where the public folder actually was. After fixing the path with `path.join(__dirname, 'lab-7/public')`, everything worked fine.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Backend Validation:</strong> Even though HTML `required` attributes exist, I made sure to also validate form data on the server side using `if (!noun || !adjective || ...)`, so the server can reject incomplete submissions gracefully.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clear Output Formatting:</strong> To ensure the final story output was readable and user-friendly, I used template literals for cleaner string interpolation and wrapped the output inside styled `<p>` tags.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      

    <footer>
        <p>Last updated:
            <span id="lastModified"></span>
        </p>
    </footer>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var x = document.lastModified;
        document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;
    </script>
</body>
</html>
