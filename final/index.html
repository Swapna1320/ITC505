    <p>
      To ensure every puzzle is solvable using the “Chase the Lights” method, I started with a fully off board and applied a series of simulated clicks. This approach avoids random unsolvable configurations. I styled the board for clarity using CSS Grid and toggled lights with immediate neighbor logic (no wrapping). One challenge I faced was preventing out-of-bounds errors when toggling edges, which I fixed by adding bounds checks. This project helped me understand DOM events, logic simulation, and why respecting puzzle rules matters in game design.
